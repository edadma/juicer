# Homebrew formula for juicer.
#
# This is a template: `tools/brew-formula.sh <version>` fills in the version and the three SHA256
# fields from the binaries the "Release binaries" workflow attaches, and the release workflow runs it
# and pushes the result to Formula/juicer.rb in the edadma/homebrew-tap repository. See README.md in
# this directory.
#
# The formula installs a prebuilt binary rather than building from source, because building means a
# JDK, sbt and Scala Native's LLVM toolchain for what ships as one executable.

  # libuv is linked into the binary; sass and esbuild are shelled out to by the asset pipeline, and
  # are deliberately not vendored so a site gets the current versions of both (see
  # AssetBuilderBackend.scala). A site with no SCSS and no JS to bundle never invokes them.

  # a squiggly template, write the file.
